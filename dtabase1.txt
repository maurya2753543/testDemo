DATABASE NOTES



Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
Even when a database is in 3rd Normal Form, still there would be anomalies resulted if it has more than one Candidate Key.

Sometimes is BCNF is also referred as 3.5 Normal Form.

4NF (Fourth Normal Form) Rules
If no database table instance contains two or more, independent and multivalued data describing the relevant entity, then it is in 4th Normal Form.

5NF (Fifth Normal Form) Rules
A table is in 5th Normal Form only if it is in 4NF and it cannot be decomposed into any number of smaller tables without loss of data.

6NF (Sixth Normal Form) Proposed
6th Normal Form is not standardized, yet however, it is being discussed by database experts for some time. Hopefully, we would have a clear & standardized definition for 6th Normal Form in the near future...

That's all to Normalization!!!

Summary
Database designing is critical to the successful implementation of a database management system that meets the data requirements of an enterprise system.
Normalization helps produce database systems that are cost-effective and have better security models.
Functional dependencies are a very important component of the normalize data process
Most database systems are normalized database up to the third normal forms.
A primary key uniquely identifies are record in a Table and cannot be null
A foreign key helps connect table and references a primary key
